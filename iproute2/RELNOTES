  * routel script. Stephen R. van den Berg <srb@cuci.nl>
  * Bug in tc/q_prio.c resetting priomap. Reported by
	Ole Husgaard <sparre@login.dknet.dk> and
	Jan Kasprzak <kas@informatics.muni.cz>
  * IP command reference manual is published (ip-cref.tex).
    I am sorry, but tc-cref.tex is still not ready, to be more
    exact the draft does not describe current tc 8-)
  * ip, rtmon, rtacct utilities are updated according to manual 8-)
    Lots of changes:
	- (MAIN) "flush" command for addr, neigh and route.
	- error messages are sanitized; now it does not print
	  usage() page on each error.
	- output format is improved.
	- "oneline" mode is added.
	- etc.
  * Name databases; resolution acsii <-> numeric is split out to lib/*
  * scripts ifcfg, ifone and rtpr.
  * examples/dhcp-client-script is copied from my patch to ISC dhcp.
  * Makefile in doc/ directory.

  * bug in tc/q_tbf.c preventing setting peak_rate, Martin Mares <mj@ucw.cz>
  * doc/flowlabels.tex

[990329]

  * This snapshot fixes some compatibility problems, which I introduced
    occasionally to previous snapshots.
  * Namely, "allot" to "tc qdisc add ... cbq" is accepted but ignored.
  * Another changes are supposed to be shown in the next snapshot, but
    because of troubles with "allot" I am forced to release premature
    varsion. Namely, "cell", "prio", "weight" etc. are optional now.
  * doc/ip-tunnels.tex

[990327]
  * History was not recorded.

[981002]
  * Rani Assaf <rani@magic.metawire.com> contributed resolving
    addresses to names.
	BEWARE! DO NOT USE THIS OPTION, WHEN REPORTING BUGS IN
	IPROUTE OR IN KERENEL. ALL THE BUG REPORTS MUST CONTAIN
	ONLY NUMERIC ADDRESSES.
