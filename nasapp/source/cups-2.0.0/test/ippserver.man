.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ippserver
is a simple Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) server conforming to the IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14) specification. It can be used to test client software or act as a very basic print server that runs a command for every job that is printed.

If two numbers are specified and the second number is greater than zero, the server will report support for color printing.
The default is "10,0".
.TP 5
.B \-v[vvv]
Be (very) verbose when logging activity to the standard output.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The
.B ippserver
program returns 1 if it is unable to process the command-line arguments or register the IPP service.
Otherwise
.B ippserver
will run continuously until terminated.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The
.B ippserver
program is unique to CUPS and conforms to the IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14) specification.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B ippserver
adds environment variables starting with "IPP_" for all IPP Job attributes in the print request.
For example, when executing a command for an IPP Job containing the "media" Job Template attribute, the "IPP_MEDIA" environment variable will be set to the value of that attribute.
.LP
Enumerated values are converted to their keyword equivalents.
For example, a "print-quality" Job Template attribute with a enum value of 3 will become the "IPP_PRINT_QUALITY" environment variable with a value of "draft".
.SH EXAMPLES
Run
.B ippserver
with a service name of My Cool Printer:
.nf

    ippserver "My Cool Printer"
.fi
.LP
Run the
.BR file (1)
command whenever a job is sent to the server:
.nf

    ippserver \-c file "My Cool Printer"
.fi
